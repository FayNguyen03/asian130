# ASIAN 130 Final Project: Collective Warriors From The East

## Abstract
Superhero is a prominent subgenre of science fiction because they feature technologically enhanced guardians, giant mecha, and antagonists created from environmental crises or speculative scientific phenomena. With global franchises like Marvel and DC Comics (Western), the genre boasts a vast and diverse audience worldwide. Most of the heroes from the West often possess extraordinary power and operate independently, so they clearly embody the spirit of individualism. Asian superhero narratives fundamentally diverge from their Western counterparts by prioritizing collective responsibility over individual power. These narratives also use futuristic conflict between humanity and hostile forces to navigate specific cultural and societal anxieties regarding rapid modernization and social cohesion. Besides, the heroes’ backstories and powers often highlight their deep inseparability from their national, cultural, and historical context. 

## Thesis
Asian superhero narratives fundamentally diverge from Western conventions by prioritizing a hero's integration into their cultural and national context as well as collectivism over individual exceptionalism. While Western media often define heroes by their personal autonomy, bravery, and unique strength, Asian counterparts ground their heroes in the traditions, histories, and collective values of their communities. According to a  recent psychological research about how Chinese people perceive heroism indicating that collectivistic cultures associate heroism primarily with traits such as  patriotism, righteousness, and social responsibility, whereas individualistic cultures emphasize personal goals and self–actualizations (Sun et al. 841–856).Therfore, the Asian superheroes’ creators usually got inspiration for their mystical, technological, or symbolic superpowers from cultural heritage and developed the plots that strengthened the idea that heroism functions as an extension of societal identity rather than personal ambition. Besides, the philosophical core of their power lies in the Doctrine of Unity. Therefore, true strength is generated mostly through collectivism, and heroes are defined by their relationships with their colleagues and community. Any complicated challenges or threat to the world cannot be solved by a single savior, but through cooperation and shared responsibility.
Furthermore, these narratives serve a critical sociological function by addressing the specific anxieties caused by rapid modernization, ranging from environmental damage and technological misuse to identity crises. Whether reflecting Japan’s emphasis on corporate harmony, Indonesia’s focus on social justice, or Vietnam’s preservation of cultural heritage, these stories offer models for maintaining social cohesion in changing times. This is visually portrayed through the genre's unique approach to technology, from mecha systems to mythologically infused armor. These are not merely for aesthetic purpose, but they represent the integration of technological advancement with traditional values, demonstrating that progress need not come at the cost of tradition but can serve as a means to preserve and strengthen cultural identity against globalizing forces. 
As the superhero genre in specific and sci-fi in general continues to evolve, Asian narratives provide crucial insights into how diverse cultures conceptualize heroism, protection, technology, and the vision of the future. These Asian superheroes stories illustrate that the future is a path shaped by the unique values and anxieties of each society and can be perceived differently across different nationality, ethnicity, and languages. The Asian superhero genre stands as a testament to the idea that technological power combined with a deep sense of cultural and national identity creates a vision of the future where the protection of the world is deeply rooted in the preservation of the community and its history.
